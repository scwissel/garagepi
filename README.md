# garagepi

This is a nodeJS application that runs on a Raspberry PI to control a garage door opener.  It uses the Express module to serve a single page application (SPA) and APIs that display the garage door status, history of the door being in the open position, a still picture from the camera, as well as controls to open and close the garage door.

The application displays the Raspberry PI CPU temp, as well as the ambient temp.  Web sockets are used to update the browser when the garage door changes position (open/close) as sensed by the door sensor.

## Networking
I have my home router configured to update a dynamic DNS service, so I can use a regular domain name instead of remembering my public IP address to access the web app.  My router then forwards to an NGINX server, which then forwards to the Raspberry Pi running the node application.

The application is secured with BASIC authentication (update username and password in config.json), so it is highly recommended to use HTTPS.  In my implementation, HTTPS is terminated in NGINX, with a forward to the Raspberry Pi, which is listening on socket 3000.

The following is a sample NGINX configuration that uses a self signed certificate and performs a proxy_pass to the Pi.  My internal DNS has garagepi and nginxservernamehere defined.  WWW traffic is sent to the /garagepi/ path, and web socket traffic is sent to /garagews/.

```
upstream garagepilogical {
        server garagepi:3000;
}

server {
        listen 8443 ssl;
        server_name nginxservernamehere;
        ssl_certificate cert.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key cert.key;
        ssl_protocols SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        ssl_ciphers "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 or HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!3DES";
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        location /garagepi/ {
                proxy_pass http://garagepilogical/;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        }
        location /garagews/ {
                proxy_pass http://garagepilogical/garagews/;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        }
}
```

##Steps
These steps include terminal commands, so a basic knowledge of using SSH is required.  PuTTY is a great terminal emulator for Windows.  Linux and Mac have ssh built in.  Getting familiar with ```vi``` or ```nano``` to edit files in a shell is also needed.  Prefixing commands with ```sudo``` will elevate your access to run and edit files that require root permissions.  More info can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/root.md).

###Install Raspbian

####Download
[Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/) can be downloaded from the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) site.  The most up to date instructions for downloading and installing on a SD card are found there.  Go with the "lite" version of Raspbian, without the full desktop.

####Image SD Card
Steps in a nutshell on a Mac:
* Download zip file of Raspbian image.
* Pop in SD card into a Mac and open Terminal.
* ```cd Downloads```
* ```unzip 2016-05-10-raspbian-jessie-lite.zip``` replace with the latest image zip file name you just downloaded.
* ```diskutil list``` to get the disk number of the SD card (ex: the number 2 in /dev/disk2)
* ```sudo dd bs=1m if=2016-05-10-raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/rdisk2``` replace image file name and your disk number.  NOTE "rdisk" here and not just "disk"!
* ```sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdisk2``` replace your disk number

####Boot Up 
Steps to Getting Raspbian Up:
* Remove your SD card from your computer and insert card into Raspberry Pi.
* You can plug in your USB WiFi adapter at this time.
* Plug the Raspberry Pi into Ethernet and power.
* Optionally plug into a monitor/TV and keyboard.  You can proceed headless, but need an ethernet cable attached.
* Raspbian will automatically boot up and resize the filesystem to fill the SD card and is ready to SSH into.

####General Troubleshooting
To check system logs, you can type ```dmesg``` to dump kernel and driver log messages when looking into issues.  This can help with checking on the USB WiFi interface.
 
####Get Online
Remote Access to Raspberry Pi (ssh)
* Perform the Setup WiFi steps if you don't have an ethernet cable attached, so you have internet access from the Pi.
* Get your Raspberry Pi IP Address
  * If you have a monitor/TV hooked up and ethernet attached, it will log "My IP address is ..." about 20 lines up from the login prompt.
  * Go to your router admin page to see what the IP address became.
  * Login with monitor/TV and keyboard attached and run ```ifconfig``` to find ```inet addr```.
* ```ssh pi@192.168.1.20``` replacing with your Raspberry Pi IP address.  Password is ```raspberry``` by default.
* Raspbian user information is documented on the [Raspbian site](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/users.md).  Changing the password is probably a good idea, since this device will be controlling your garage door.
* Either via Ethernet or WiFi, the Raspberry Pi needs to be on a network and connected to the internet at this point.

####Apply Updates
Make sure Raspbian is all up to date.  This could take some time to finish.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

And the Raspberry Pi firmware is up to date.
```
sudo rpi-update
```

If rpi-update is not installed, install it with ```sudo apt-get install rpi-update```.

It is probably best to reboot at this point.
```
sudo reboot
```

###Setup WiFi
This is probably one of the first things you'll want to do so you can SSH into the Pi.  Plug in the wireless USB adapter to get started.  Instructions can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md), but here's the gist of it.

You can scan for WiFi networks using ```sudo iwlist wlan0 scan```.  This is an easy way to make sure the adapter is recognized and working.  To get connected, you need to know your routers SSID and password.  This should work for both WPA and WPA2 security.

Add the following to the bottom of the ```/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf``` file.  In order to get permissions, you'll have to ```sudo vi /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf```.

```
network={
    ssid="YourRouterSSID"
    psk="YourRouterPassword"
}
```

It should notice the file changed and try to connect to your router, if you do not have enthernet connected.  Your best bet is to do a reboot (```sudo reboot```) at this point and unplug the ethernet cable before it boots up.  The IP address would have now changed, since it is now using WiFi instead of ethernet.

###Setup Raspbian for OneWire Support
Raspbian includes support for the OneWire bus used by the DS18B20 temperature sensor.  Here's how to enable it.

Add ```dtoverlay=w1-gpio``` to the /boot/config.txt.

Reboot with ```sudo reboot```.

With the sensor connected to GPIO 4, confirm it is recognized by going to the w1 devices folder, seeing a device listed starting with 28 (usually), and checking the w1_slave file for a reading.  My ID was 28-01156206bdff, so yours will be different.

```
pi@garagepi ~ $ cd /sys/bus/w1/devices
pi@garagepi /sys/bus/w1/devices $ ls
28-01156206bdff  w1_bus_master1
pi@garagepi /sys/bus/w1/devices $ cd 28-01156206bdff
pi@garagepi /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-01156206bdff $ cat w1_slave 
70 01 80 80 1f ff 80 80 7a : crc=7a YES
70 01 80 80 1f ff 80 80 7a t=23000
pi@garagepi /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-01156206bdff $
```

Make sure to update the garageapi.js file to have your ID.  (NOTE: in the future this setting should be moved into config.js)

```
// read ambient temp
setInterval(function(){
  ambtemp = utils.w1Temp('28-01156206bdff');
}, 5000);
```

###Setup Camera
Use ```raspi-config``` to enable the camera.  [More info](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/camera.md)

###Setup WiringPi
[WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) is a command-line utility to operate the GPIO pins.  It will be used to check the position of the garage door and operate the relay for the garage door opener.  Install it as follows.
```
sudo apt-get install wiringpi
```

###Setup Garage Door Position Sensor
With the reed switch connected to GPIO15 and a ground pin, here's how to test the operation.  ```gpio``` is a command-line utility that we'll use to test.

To set GPIO15 as an input pin, use ```gpio -g mode 15 in```.

To read the state of GPIO15, use ```gpio -g read 15```.  An output of ```0``` means the door is closed, ```1``` means the door is open.

###Setup the Garage Door Button Relay
With the relay connected to GPIO2, 5 volt and ground pins, we can use the ```gpio``` command-line to test the operation.

To set GPIO2 as an output pin, use ```gpio -g mode 2 out```.

To close the relay, we need to set the value to zero with ```gpio -g write 2 1```.

To open the relay, we need to set the value to one with ```gpio -g write 2 0```.

To simulate a button press where the relay closes for 250ms, the following script can be used as a test:

```
#!/bin/bash
gpio -g mode 2 out
gpio -g write 2 1
sleep .25
gpio -g write 2 0
```

###Install Dependencies
The following will install the other dependencies needed.

####Install node
Node can be installled from the default repositories, but it is older and runs by the command ```nodejs```, which is bothersome.  This needs to be improved to install the latest node and is a bit of a mess right now, but these instructions get you going.
```
curl -sLS https://apt.adafruit.com/add | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install node
```

####Install NPM and Git
These are also needed.
```
sudo apt-get install npm git
```

####Install GPIO-Admin
[gpio-admin](https://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-gpio-admin) allows for non-root access to the GPIO pins, and is a dependency for the NPM package pi-gpio.

Here's the commands to download, build and install:
```
git clone git://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-gpio-admin.git
cd quick2wire-gpio-admin
make
sudo make install
sudo adduser $USER gpio
```

###Setup GaragePi
Grab garagepi from git using ```git clone https://github.com/scwissel/garagepi.git garagepi```.  Go into the garagepi folder and run ```npm install``` to install and dependent node packages.

Make sure to update the following:

* Temp sensor ID for your DS18B20 in garageapi.js.
* Your chosen username and password in config.js.

Start garagepi with ```node garageapi.js```.

Access the web application by browsing to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi on port 3000.  For example, if your Raspberry Pi has an IP address of 192.168.1.10, then use the following in your laptop or PC browser while connected to the same WiFi network as the Raspberry Pi: ```http://192.168.1.10:3000```.  You should get prompted to login with your username and password you setup in config.js and see the main page.

##To Do

* Terminate HTTPS at the Raspberry Pi to reduce complexity of setup.
* Move hard-coded values into configuration, such as tempurature sensor ID and GPIO pins used.
* Clean-up dependencies.
* More detailed instructions on installation of OS, this and dependencies, networking, and wiring.
* Add support for second garage door.
